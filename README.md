This repository contains a project focused on detecting skew and prediction drift in AI models using Evidently AI. The analysis is performed on two datasets: Titanic and Diabetes Prediction, highlighting the importance of monitoring data drift to maintain model reliability and accuracy. Drift detection is visualized through Evidently AI reports, showcasing changes in feature distributions such as "Fare" (Titanic dataset) and "BMI" (Diabetes dataset). These insights are crucial for ensuring AI systems adapt to real-world changes and remain trustworthy.

Key Features:
Implementation of Evidently AI for drift detection.

Analysis of drift in "Fare" (Titanic dataset) and "BMI" (Diabetes dataset).

Visualization of feature distribution shifts.

Automated reporting for actionable insights.

Visualizations:
Titanic Dataset (Fare Drift): Demonstrates the impact of pricing changes on survival predictions.

Diabetes Prediction Dataset (BMI Drift): Highlights the effect of health metric changes on diabetes risk predictions.

This repository serves as a practical example for integrating drift detection into MLOps pipelines to ensure scalable and reliable AI systems.
